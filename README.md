PlayRM RESTful API Documentation
================================

This guide showcases the features of the PlayRM RESTful API, provides a sample API client written in PHP, and documents what information can be sent via server-side requests.

PlayRM provides game developers with tools for tracking player behavior and engagement so that they can:

* Better understand and segment their audience
* Reach out to new, like-minded players
* Retain their current audience
* Ultimately generate more revenue for their games

Using the PlayRM RESTful API provides you with the flexibility to leverage PlayRM accross multiple games in conjunction with existing systems eg: payments, registration. If you already have an existing game server, this may simplify your integration with PlayRM.

The client SDKs do provide some additional functionality that is not available with a pure server-side integration:
* Segmented messaging
* Engagement module which allows PlayRM to track and score player intensity
* Geo location of the player

To access this functionality you'll want to implement the appropriate client-side SDK in your game client (JavaScript, iOS, Unity, Android, etc). The engagement module and the player geo location information are automatically once the SDK has been installed.

These modules are available by calling the RESTful API:
 
* [UserInfo Module](#demographics-and-install-attribution) - provides basic user information
* [Monetization Module](#monetization) - tracks various monetization events
* [Viral Module](#invitations-and-virality) - tracks the social activities of users
* [Milestone Module](#custom-event-tracking) - tracks pre-defined significant events in the game experience

Prerequisites
=============
Before you can integrate with the PlayRM SDK you'll need to sign up and register your game.

## Signing Up for the PlayRM Service

Visit <a href="https://controlpanel.playnomics.com/signup" target="_blank">https://controlpanel.playnomics.com/signup</a> to create an account. The control panel is the dashboard to manage all of the PlayRM features once the SDK integration has been completed.

## Register Your Game
After receiving a registration confirmation email, login to the <a href="https://controlpanel.playnomics.com" target="_blank">control panel</a>. Select the "Applications" tab and create a new application. Your application will be granted an `App ID` and an `API Key`.

Server-Side Integration
=======================

## Common Parameters

For every request sent to the API, we require you to submit the following parameters:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><em>timestamp</em></td>
            <td>32-bit signed integer, 64-bit signed integer, or 64-bit double</td>
            <td>
                The time an event took place. The value may be one of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Unix epoch time in seconds since Jan 1, 1970 i.e., <em>ssssssssss</em></li>
                    <li>Unix epoch time in seconds since Jan 1, 1970 with milliseconds as a decimal, i.e., <em>ssssssssss.mmm</em></li>
                    <li>Unix epoch time in milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970, i.e., <em>ssssssssssmmm</em></li>
                </ul>

                Values &gt; 2147483647 or &lt; -2147483648 are assumed to be epoch time in milliseconds and may not contain a decimal component. To indicate times prior to Jan 1, 1970, use a negative timestamp.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>appId</em></td>
            <td>32-bit signed integer</td>
            <td>Playnomics-assigned identifier for the application in which an event occurred</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><em>userId</em></td>
            <td>String, 64 char max, UTF-8</td>
            <td>
                The <em>User ID</em> should be a persistent, anonymized, and unique identifier to each player.
                
                You can also use third-party authorization providers like Facebook or Twitter. However, <strong>you cannot use the user's Facebook ID or any personally identifiable information (plain-text email, name, etc) for the <em>User ID</em>.</strong>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Instantiating the PHP Client

To use the PHP PlaynomicsApiClient, fork this repository or download the source files. You can then import the PlaynomicsApiClient into your server-side code:

```php
require_once "<PATH-TO-PLAYNOMICS-API-CLIENT>/PlaynomicsApiClient.php";

//...
//...
//...

//optionally set a proxy to send requests through
$proxy = "localhost:8888";

$api_client = new PlaynomicsApiClient($app_id, $api_key, $proxy);

//when testing, you can point the client to our testing API so that events won't get logged in the control panel
//dashboard

$api_client->test_mode = true;
```

The `$proxy` variable is entirely optional. You should make sure that `$api_client->test_mode` is set to `false` when you are ready to deploy your code to production.

## Signing Requests

You should sign each request with your `API Key` to ensure that only events originating from your application are accepted by the API. This is done by appending an additional signature parameter, `sig`. The signature process is very similar to that of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-12" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a>. The signature process requires a shared key, the `API Key`.

Process to sign a request:
* Generate the canonical URL
    * Start with the URI path from the first "/" after the hostname
    * Remove any signature parameters (e.g., sig) if they exist
    * Re­order the query parameters to be in case-­insensitive, alphabetical order
* Compute the signature using HMAC+SHA256 with your application's `API Key` and the canonical url string from the previous step
* Append the signature as a the `sig` parameter, but make sure that you URL encode the value

`PlaynomicsApiClient` demonstrates how to do this:

```php
private function sendRequest($path, $query_params) {
    $base_url = $this->test_mode
        ? "http://api.b.playnomics.net"
        : "http://api.a.playnomics.net";
    
    $has_params = $query_params && count($query_params) > 0;
    
    if($has_params) {
        //sort the array by its keys
        ksort($query_params);
        $first_param = true;
        foreach($query_params as $key => $value) {
            if(isset($value) && $value != ""){
                $path .=  ($first_param ? "?" : "&") . urlencode($key) . "=" . urlencode($value);
                $first_param = false;
            }
        }
    }

    $signature = hash_hmac("sha256", $path, $this->api_key);
    $path .= ($has_params ? "&" : "?") . "sig=" . urlencode($signature);

    $request_url = $base_url . $path;
        
    $curl_get = curl_init();
    curl_setopt_array($curl_get, array(
        CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => 1,
        CURLOPT_URL => $request_url,
        //fail on anything where the HTTP status code is 400 or higher
        CURLOPT_FAILONERROR => 1
    ));

    if($this->proxy){
        curl_setopt($curl_get, CURLOPT_PROXY, $this->proxy);
    }
        
    $response = curl_exec($curl_get);

    if(!$response) {
        error_log("Could not make request to " . $request_url);
        error_log('Error: "' . curl_error($curl_get) . '" - Code: ' . curl_errno($curl_get));
    }

    curl_close($curl_get);
    return $response;
}
```

## Demographics and Install Attribution

The userInfo module can be called to collect basic demographic and acquisition information. This data can be used to segment users based on how/where they were acquired, and enables improved targeting with basic demographics in addition to the behavioral data collected using other events.

PlayRM collects all userInfo events for the same userId and coalesces the information in the events to build an information catalog for that user. In the case of a conflict (such as two events for the same userId with different country parameters), Playnomics uses the information from the event with the most recent timestamp parameter. Since users may have been created prior to instrumentation, it is suggested that you send a userInfo event at the start of each user's session (e.g., upon login) to update that user's catalog information and to increase coverage of players in the catalog.

```

## Monetization

PlayRM provides a flexible interface for tracking monetization events. This module should be called every time a player triggers a monetization event. 

This event tracks users that have monetized and the amount they have spent in total, real currency:
* FBC (Facebook Credits)
* USD (US Dollars)
* OFD (offer valued in USD)
or an in-game *virtual* currency.

* [Purchases of In-Game Currency with Real Currency](#purchases-of-in-game-currency-with-real-currency)
* [Purchases of Items with Real Currency](#purchases-of-items-with-real-currency)
* [Purchases of Items with In-Game Currency](#purchases-of-items-with-in-game-currency)

### Purchases of In-Game Currency with Real Currency

A very common monetization strategy is to incentivize players to purchase premium, in-game currency with real currency. PlayRM treats this like a currency exchange. This is one of the few cases where currency metadata: *currencyTypes*, *currencyValues*, *currencyCategories* are expressed in an array form. *itemId*, *quantity*, and *otherUserId* are not included.

Example: player purchases 500 Gold Coins for 10 USD.

Call with PHP REST Client:

```php
$args = array(
    "user_id" => $player_id,
    "transaction_id" => $transaction_id,
    "currencies" => array(
        0 => TransactionCurrency::createVirtual("Gold Coins", 500),
        1 => TransactionCurrency::createReal("USD", -10)
    ),
    "type" => TransactionType::CurrencyConvert
);

$api_client->transaction($args);
```

Resulting HTTP GET:
```

    a=4104146557547035721&
    r=36&
    t=1367941381&

    ta1=r&

    sig=e58c38ecc4cde6a6b7522621f689895dd7c8d7efacb4d311fb2db75fa64fee48
```

### Purchases of Items with Real Currency

Example: player purchases a "Sword" for $.99 USD.

Call with PHP REST Client:

```php
$args = array(
    "user_id" => $player_id,
    "transaction_id" => $transaction_id,
    "currencies" => array(
        1 => TransactionCurrency::createReal("USD", .99)
    ),
    "type" => TransactionType::BuyItem,
    "quantity" => 1,
    "item_id" => "Sword"
);

$api_client->transaction($args);
```

Resulting HTTP GET:
```
http://api.a.playnomics.net/v1/transaction?
    a=4104146557547035721&
    i=Sword&
    r=43&
    t=1367941381&
    ta0=r&
    tc0=USD
    &tq=1&
    tt=BuyItem&
    tv0=0.99&
    u=1&
    sig=5eb51bccc53480d852c2cffccf83e87e33997587e2d817a5dd86c26b772778c0
```

### Purchases of Items with Premium Currency

This event is used to segment monetized users (and potential future monetizers) by collecting information about how and when they spend their premium currency (an in-game currency that is primarily acquired using a *real* currency). This is one level of information deeper than the previous use-cases.

#### Currency Exchanges

This is a continuation on the first currency exchange example. It showcases how to track each purchase of in-game *attention* currency (non-premium virtual currency) paid for with a *premium*:

Example: in this hypothetical, Energy is an attention currency that is earned over the lifetime of the game. They can also be purchased with the premium Gold Coins that the player may have purchased earlier. The player buys 100 Energy with 10 Gold Coins.

Call with PHP REST Client:
```php
$args = array(
    "user_id" => $player_id,
    "transaction_id" => $transaction_id,
    "currencies" => array(
        0 => TransactionCurrency::createVirtual("Gold Coins", -10),
        1 => TransactionCurrency::createVirtual("Energy", 100),
    ),
    "type" => TransactionType::CurrencyConvert,
);

$api_client->transaction($args);
```

Resulting HTTP GET:
```
http://api.a.playnomics.net/v1/transaction?

    r=83&

    ta1=v&
    tc0=Gold+Coins&
    tc1=Energy&

```

#### Item Purchases

This is a continuation on the first item purchase example, except with premium currency.

Hypothetical: player buys 20 Light Armor with 5 Gold Coins.

Call with PHP REST Client:
```php
$args = array(
    "user_id" => $player_id,
    "transaction_id" => $transaction_id,
    "currencies" => array(
        1 => TransactionCurrency::createVirtual("Gold Coins", 5)
    ), 
    "type" => TransactionType::BuyItem,
    "quantity" => 20,
    "item_id" => "Light Armor"
);

$api_client->transaction($args);
```

Resulting HTTP GET:
```
http://api.a.playnomics.net/v1/transaction?
    a=4104146557547035721&
    i=Light+Armor&
    r=26&
    t=1367941381&
    ta0=v&
    tc0=Gold+Coins&
    tq=20&
    tt=BuyItem&

## Invitations and Virality

The virality module allows you to track a singular invitation from one user to another (e.g., inviting friends to join a game on Facebook).

```

You can then track each invitation response. The important thing to note is that you will need to persist the *invitationId* in invitation callback URL (e.g. the link that the player two clicks on should contain the original *invitationId*).

## Custom Event Tracking

Milestones may be defined in a number of ways.  They may be defined at certain key gameplay points like finishing a tutorial, or may they refer to other important milestones in a user’s lifecycle. PlayRM, by default, supports up to five custom milestones.  Users can be segmented based on when and how many times they have achieved a particular milestone.
